- **Tax Agent Services Act 2009**: Establishes the Tax Practitioners Board (TPB) and regulates the registration of tax agents and BAS service providers.
- **Tax Practitioners Board (TPB)**: Administers the system of registration, investigates applications, and imposes sanctions for non-compliance.

## Tax Agent Registration
- **Eligibility**:
  - Individuals, partnerships, or companies can apply for registration.
  - All applicants must be "fit and proper persons" and meet the relevant education and experience requirements.
- **Re-registration**: Required every three years with similar requirements as the initial registration.

## “Safe Harbour” Protection

## Tax Agent Lodgment Program

## Termination of Registration
- Registration may be terminated if a tax agent:
  - Is convicted of a serious tax offence.
  - Is involved in fraud or dishonesty.
  - Becomes bankrupt or goes into administration.
